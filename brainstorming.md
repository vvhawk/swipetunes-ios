## Chos3n

1. **Swipetunes**

Mobile: 
Audio, Swipes, Scroll app integral

Story: 
Combines something people are aware of, modern dating, with another struggle, finding new music

Market: 
Quite large considering it tailors to anyone who has a spotify account and anyone who likes music

Habit: 
Swiping can be addicting because the content is always fresh

Scope: 
Managable in pieces. Built this for CodePath Android 102

2. **Emojo**

Mobile: 
Swiping and Accesibility when on the go

Story: 
Combines something mundane (journaling) with something fun (emojis)

Market: 
Quite large considering mental health is more important than ever

Habit: 
Not too addicting. Can even limit daily entries. 

Scope: 
Managable in pieces. Built this for CodePath Android 102.

3. **myAudiofiler**

Mobile: 
Audio centered and on the go approach

Story: 
Digitizes record collecting, a very physical hobby

Market: 
Quite large considering vinyl sales are up

Habit: 
Not addicting because usage is tied with collection size

Scope: 
Managable in pieces. Discogs API may be difficult as I don't have experience with it.
